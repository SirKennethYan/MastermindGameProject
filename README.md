### Functionality

The MastermindGame project is a console-based implementation of the classic Mastermind game. It offers the following functionality:

Game Initialization:

<ul>
    <li>The computer randomly selects a pattern of four different numbers within specified difficulty levels and min-max values using a Random generator API https://www.random.org/clients/http/api/</li>
    <li>The selected combination remains unknown to the player.</li>
    <li>Duplicate numbers are possible.</li>
</ul>

Game Rules:

<ul>
    <li>The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct 4-number combination.</li>
    <li>After each guess, the computer provides feedback:</li>
    <li>X (ex's): Incorrect number.</li>
    <li>O (oh's): Correct number in the correct position.</li>
    <li>_ (underscore): Correct number in the wrong position.</li>
</ul>

Modes:

<ul>
    <li>1-Player: Player guesses the code generated by Random generator API.</li>
    <li>2-Player: Code Maker sets a super secret code, and the Code Breaker guesses it.</li>
</ul>

Difficulty Levels:

<ul>
    <li>Easy: 12 attempts, numbers from 1 to 6.</li>
    <li>Medium: 10 attempts, numbers from 1 to 8 (default).</li>
    <li>Hard: 8 attempts, numbers from 1 to 10.</li>
</ul>

Game Termination:

<ul>
    <li>If the player guesses the correct code, the game congratulates 🎉 the player and offers the option to play again.</li>
    <li>If the player runs out of attempts, the correct code is revealed, and the option to start a new game is provided.</li>
</ul>
