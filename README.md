<h3 align="center">Mastermind ðŸ¤¯ Game</h3>

### Functionality

The MastermindGame project is a console-based implementation of the classic Mastermind game. It offers the following functionality:

Game Initialization:

<ul>
    <li>The computer randomly selects a pattern of four different numbers within specified difficulty levels and min-max values using a Random generator API https://www.random.org/clients/http/api/</li>
    <li>The selected combination remains unknown to the player.</li>
    <li>Duplicate numbers are possible.</li>
</ul>

Game Rules:

<ul>
    <li>The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct 4-number combination.</li>
    <li>After each guess, the computer provides feedback:</li>
    <li>X (ex's): Incorrect number.</li>
    <li>O (oh's): Correct number in the correct position.</li>
    <li>\_ (underscore): Correct number in the wrong position.</li>
</ul>

Modes:

1-Player: Player guesses the code generated by the computer.
2-Player: Code Maker sets a secret code, and the Code Breaker guesses it.
Difficulty Levels:

Easy: 12 attempts, numbers from 1 to 6.
Medium: 10 attempts, numbers from 1 to 8 (default).
Hard: 8 attempts, numbers from 1 to 10.
Game Termination:

If the player guesses the correct code, the game congratulates the player and offers the option to play again.
If the player runs out of attempts, the correct code is revealed, and the option to start a new game is provided.
