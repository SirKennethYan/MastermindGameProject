**Objective:**
Guess the correct 4-number combination within the allotted attempts.

**Difficulty Levels:**
- Easy:    Attempts: 12, Range: 1-6

**Game Initialization:**
- In 1-Player mode, the computer randomly selects a hidden pattern of four numbers within the chosen range.
- In 2-Player mode, one player becomes the Code Maker and sets the pattern.
- The selected combination is kept secret from the other player.
- Duplicate numbers are possible.

**Game Rules:**
1. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct 4-number combination.
2. After each guess, feedback is provided:
   - **■**: Correct number in the correct position.
   - **_**: Correct number in the wrong position.
   - **x**: Incorrect number.

**Example Run:**
- The game starts with a random combination (e.g., "0 1 3 5").
- Player guesses (e.g., "2 2 4 6"), and the response is "x x x x".
- Another guess (e.g., "0 1 5 3") gets "■ ■ _ _".
- A correct guess (e.g., "0 1 3 5") results in "■ ■ ■ ■".
- "Congratulations! You guessed the correct code!"
