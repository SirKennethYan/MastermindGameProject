Game Objective:
----------------
Try to guess the correct 4-number combination within 10 attempts to win the game.

Game Initialization:
---------------------
- The computer randomly selects a pattern of four different numbers from 1 to 8.
- The selected combination remains unknown to the player.
- Duplicate numbers are possible.

Game Rules:
------------
1. You have 10 attempts to guess the correct 4-number combination.
2. After each guess, the computer will provide feedback:
   - "Correct Number": You guessed a correct number (wrong position).
   - "Correct Position": You guessed a correct number in the correct position.
   - "All Incorrect": Your guess was entirely incorrect.

Example Run:
--------------
The game initializes and selects a combination (e.g., "0 1 3 5").
The player guesses (e.g., "2 2 4 6"), and the game responds with "All Incorrect."
The player continues to guess, and the computer provides feedback based on each attempt.

Good luck, and enjoy the game!
